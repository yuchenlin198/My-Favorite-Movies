This project shows Yuchen Lin's favorite movies along with box art covers and
links to trailers. The project was created by Yuchen Lin as part of his full
stack web developer nanodegree program.

What‘s included
   -- entertainment_center.py
   -- fresh_tomatoes.py
   -- media.py
   —- README.txt

Quick Start
   1) To successfully run the program, you will first need to have python 
      installed in your computer. Here is a link on installing python 2.
      https://www.python.org/downloads/
   2) Next, you will download the zipped file named "Yuchen's Favorite Movies"
      and unzip the file into your local computer. 
   3) Entering the unzipped folder, you will then open the file 
      "entertainment_center.py" with python IDLE that comes with your python 2 
      installation. Make sure that the three files "entertainment_center.py",
      "fresh_tomatoes.py" and "media.py" are in the same folder.
   4) Lastly, click run -> run module to run the program. Of course, you will 
      need at least one web browser (chrome, Safari, IE etc.) installed in 
      your computer to successfully run the program.

Note
    This project is powered by a python module "fresh_tomatoes.py" provided by
    Udacity staffs. I make a few edits to the module including but not limited
    to changing the website title, texts in the banner, font and size of movie
    names, grid layout and hover effects.
